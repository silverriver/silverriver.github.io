## PersonalDialog

### About
The PersonalDialog dataset is a large-scale multi-turn Chinese dialogue dataset containing various traits from a large number of speakers. The whole dataset consists of 20.83M sessions and 56.25M utterances from 8.47M speakers. Each utterance is associated with a speaker marked with traits like Age, Gender, Location, Interest Tags, etc. Several anonymization schemes are designed to protect the privacy of each speaker. This large-scale dataset will facilitate not only the study of personalized dialogue generation but also other researches on sociolinguistics or social science.
You can find more details from this paper: [Personalized Dialogue Generation with Diversified Traits](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09672)
